First one is by using Git client if git software is installed on your computer or by downloading zip file from GitHub when you don't have git software installed\n\nClone shopizer using git command line\n\nIn order to perform this, you must have a git client installed on your workstation.\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer.git\n\nThis will clone default Shopizer branch\n\nDownload Shopizer zip file from Git Hub\n\nShopizer download link\n\nRequirements\n\nShopizer is built using Java and requires Java Development Kit version 8 installed. First step is to check if java is installed. For this open a shell or command line.\n\n$ java -version\n\nIn order to build Shopizer you should have a complete Java SDK (software development kit) available on your machine. In order to verify if java sdk is installed on your computer use this command:\n\n$ javac\n\nYou should see which version of java is installed and if a SDK is available. Version 8 of java SDK is required and can be downloaded from here Java version 8\n\nFor any questions on software requirements and download process feel free to ask questions on Shopizer Forum\n\nSee Shopizer forum for asking Shopizer requirements related questions.\n\nSee also\n\nWhat is Shopizer\nBuild and run locally","wordCount":234,"type":"Content"},{"name":"Build and run locally","description":"Build and run on your local machine","path":"/starting/buildandrunlocally","text":"Run locally\n\nThe purpose of this section is to provide new users with the basics of Shopizer e-commerce framework in order to get started in their projects.
